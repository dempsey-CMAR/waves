Variable,Unit,Description,Questions
Hs,m,Significant wave height (difference between crest and neighboring trough). Defined as the 4th root of the estimated variance of the interval. Similar in magnitude to the average height of the top 1/3 of waves from the zero crossing analysis.,The esimated variance of what? All measurements made in the burst/ensemble?
H1/10,m,Average height of the top 10 % largest waves from the zero crossing analysis.,For each burst/ensemble?
H1/3,m,Average height of the top 33 % largest waves from the zero crossing analysis.,
Hmax,m,Height of the largest wave from the zero crossing analysis.,
Tp,s,Peak period. Wave period associated with the largest peak in the power spectrum.,Is this period related to Hs?
T1/10,s,Period average of the top 10 % largest waves from the zero crossing analysis.,"Is there an average in here somewhere? Manual says ""Period average of Top 1/3 Largest Waves"""
T1/3,s,Period average of the top 33 % largest waves from the zero crossing analysis.,
Tmax,s,Period of largest wave from zero crossing analysis.,
Dp,degrees,Peak direction. Direction at the peak period.,
Depth,m,Sensor depth.,
CM,m / s,Current magnitude.,
CD,degrees,Current direction.,
